# Shooting Incidents in NYC Skyrocket in 2020 due to Strained Law Enforcement, New Laws and Hate Crimes Caused by the Pandemic

## Overview of Paper
This paper explore the sudden surge in gun violence since the beginning of the pandemic in New York City. The data used is the NYPD Shooting Incident Data from NYC OpenData. New bail reform laws and consequences due to the COVID-19 outbreak have led a doubling number in shooting incidents in 2020. Through an in-depth analysis of the demographics of the victim as well as information such as location and date of the incidents, we found that a lack of police enforcement, increased poverty and racially motivated hate crime are all possible underlying causes for this surge.
